Electric vehicles, often referred to as EVs, first gained attention in the late 19th century, even before gasoline cars became dominant. They were quiet, easy to operate, and popular among city residents. However, when cheap oil was discovered and Henry Ford’s assembly line made gasoline cars affordable, the popularity of electric ones began to fade. Still, some early engineers continued experimenting with battery efficiency, believing that “their time would come again.”
